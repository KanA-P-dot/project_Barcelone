Our e-commerce website, 'School Stuff,' serves as a dedicated platform for online school supply sales. Our overarching mission is to streamline the back-to-school experience, offering convenience and efficiency to both students and their parents. Within our virtual store, you'll discover an extensive array of school essentials, ranging from backpacks to simple pens, catering to students spanning from primary school through high school. Our ultimate objective is to empower students with the ability to swiftly and comprehensively assemble their required school supplies in a single, hassle-free purchase.

To enhance the ease of the shopping process, we've thoughtfully crafted school supply packs designed to align with various grade levels. These packs are available at varying price points, reflecting the diverse preferences and quality expectations of students. Additionally, we've cultivated strategic collaborations with beloved brands such as Marvel, Batman, and Barbie, which are particularly appealing to younger students. For older students, our partnerships extend to renowned clothing brands like McDonald's and others, ensuring a diverse product selection that caters to all tastes.

Our primary demographic focus centers on young students, and our marketing strategy revolves around capturing their attention through channels that cater to their interests. We leverage platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and children's gaming advertisements to engage this audience effectively. We firmly believe that the allure of matching their school supplies with their favorite themes, combined with the extensive product choices we offer, will captivate the imaginations of young learners and their parents, making 'School Stuff' their go-to destination for all things related to school supplies.

Project Progression: We began by selecting our niche, which is school supplies, based on its consistent market demand. Then, we worked on our brand image, including the name, slogan, and logo, to create a coherent identity. After that, we planned the website's architecture using a Figma mockup to have a clear project vision. Once the design was established, we organized our work using Git for coding and Trello for task management, based on our skills and expertise levels.

Organization: We created a Trello board to list all tasks to be completed without specifically assigning each task to a team member. We also used a Discord chat channel for real-time communication regarding our progress and discussions about remaining tasks. This approach allowed us to maintain seamless communication and respond quickly to project needs.
